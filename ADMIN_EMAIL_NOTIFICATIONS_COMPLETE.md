## How It Works

### Payment Flow with Email

```
1. User completes payment via Razorpay
   ↓
2. Payment verification endpoint called
   ↓
3. Payment signature verified
   ↓
4. Order status updated to "Paid"
   ↓
5. **Email sent to admin** 📧
   ↓
6. User redirected to order detail page
```

### Email Sending Process

```javascript
// In payment verification route
try {
  // Payment verified - Update order
  order.paymentStatus = 'Paid';
  await order.save();
  
  // Send email notification to admin
  const emailResult = await sendOrderNotification(order, user);
  
  if (emailResult.success) {
    console.log('✅ Admin notified via email');
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  // Email failure doesn't affect payment
  console.error('Email failed but payment succeeded');
}
```
